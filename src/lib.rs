//! This crate implements the [embedded-nal] network traits for operating systems that support the
//! standard library's network.
//!
//! UDP and TCP sockets are plainly wrapped and should behave unsuspiciously.
//!
//! The DNS implementation is slightly incomplete, as the Rust standard library contains no
//! provisions to turn IP addresses back into hosts; that call thus fails unconditionally.
//!
//! All implementations use `std::io::Error` as their error type.
//!

/// The user may instantiate a stack using the `Stack::default()` function.
///
/// The stack can be cloned, as it is not a resource that needs any synchronization. This is not
/// made implicit as Copy, though (although there's not technical reason not to). That is to alert
/// users to the difficulties that'd arise when copying around a stack rather than using it through
/// some mechanism of synchronization (which is generally required with ``embedded_nal`` since
/// version 0.3).
