# `std-embedded-nal`

This crate implements the [embedded-nal] network traits for operating systems that support the standard library's network.
.

In that, it is to embedded-nal what [linux-embedded-hal] is to [embedded-hal]:
A way to use libraries written for the bare-metal embedded world on Linux.
(Just that network interfaces are better standardized than hardware access, so it should work on any system).

# Usage

As the operating system's network stack is always available,
it can be referenced at any time:

```rust
use std_embedded_nal::UDP;
use mebdedded_nal::{UdpStack, Mode};

let message = [0x50, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00];

let mut socket = UDP.open("127.0.0.1:5683".parse()?, Mode::Blocking)?;
UDP.write(socket, message)?;
```

# Maturity

This crate so far only consists of documentation of what it should do.

# Minimum Supported Rust Version

This crate is build-tested on stable Rust 1.36.0.
It *might* compile with older versions but that may change at any time.
